An example of how to use https://github.com/PaulNovack/CppZeroMQAsynchSQLServer in a fresh symfony project by creating a CustomRepository

To work better with CppZeroMQAsynchSQLServer the server should return error responses better.

## When to Use CustomRepository for Asynchronous Fetching

The `CustomRepository` and asynchronous sql becomes particularly useful in scenarios where multiple database queries need to be executed concurrently. By fetching data asynchronously, it can significantly reduce the total time taken to load a page, especially when dealing with complex queries or when querying multiple tables. This approach is beneficial in applications where real-time data processing is crucial, such as in dashboards or analytics platforms.

However, using asynchronous fetching may not provide noticeable speed improvements when there is only a single query in a controller. In such cases, the overhead of setting up asynchronous communication might outweigh the benefits. It's most effective when you have multiple independent queries that can be executed in parallel, thereby reducing the overall response time.
